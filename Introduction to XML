    removed from them.

    displayed and can be used in many different presentaion scenarios

    while HTML is used to present the same data
8) XML separates data from HTML -- With XML Data can be stored in separate XML files. and with the help of small code of 
    javascript in HTML file can read the XML file into the HTML page and use it.
    For example : consider the XML file named as Books.xml in the same directory of our XML_project
